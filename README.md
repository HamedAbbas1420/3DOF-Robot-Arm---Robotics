 * This is an application project mainly on Robotics inverse kinematics.
 * 3R (3 revolute joints): Base, Shoulder and Elbow. you can add end effector if you want, i did not use end effector gripper.
 * inverse kinematics approach: How to make the end effector reach specific position?
 * Using end effector position to get joint angles required to reach this position
 *
 * Notes can be found in its related folder
 * you can watch the video of testing the robot on my LinkedIn:
