/**
 * Electronics notes:`
 * make sure to operate the servo motors as described in the datasheet, 
 * here i am using 3 Mg995 servo motors which operate within 4.8v - 7.2volts and require about 1amp/each motor
 * for servo motor powering, you can use one of these:
 * 1) Two 18650 li batteries in series(2*3.7=7.4v) entering to a buck converter circuit (MUST, not to damage servo motors)
 * 2) Your PC USB cable (not recommended if you load on servo motors)
 * 
 * Components:
 * Arduino UNO
 * 3X Servo motors Mg995
 * Jumper wires (male-male , male-female)3
